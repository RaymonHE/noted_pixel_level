# noted_pixel_calibration
This document is a code analysis of pixel level calibration, aiming at consisting more people to gain a better understanding of the procedure workflow. Especially, crucial functions are explained specifically such as feature extration, projection etc. 
**lidar_camera_calib** is a robust, high accuracy extrinsic calibration tool between high resolution LiDAR (e.g. Livox) and camera in targetless environment. Our algorithm can run in both indoor and outdoor scenes, and only requires edge information in the scene. If the scene is suitable, we can achieve pixel-level accuracy similar to or even beyond the target based method.
